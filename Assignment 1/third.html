        As the third year rolled around, I was finally in my major for
        Management Information Systems and I began working on developing my
        skills as a professional. Continuing through as the Vice President of
        AKPsi, I had now set my eyes on becoming the President. Through a lot of
        work, I was nominated and elected the President in my third year.
        Furthermore, the friendships continued to grow and I had the opportunity
        to experience my first set of MIS courses. I learned about Systems
        Design, Programming, and Database development. Along with my classes, I
        competed in two case competition, one in Fall and one in Winter. Both
        were very stressful and fun, and I am very grateful to have competed in
        such business competitions. Through out the year I was also out on my
        internship search, hoping to get another opportunity to gain real world
        experience and build up my skills. With the help of one of my friends,
        who recommended me for her internship role, I secured a position at a
        software company that develops software for non-profits, grant makers,
        and community foundations. It is an opportunity, I am very grateful for
        as it has allowed me to learn and grow more as a professional.
