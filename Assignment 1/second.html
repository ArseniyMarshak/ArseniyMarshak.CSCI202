        In my second year I continued as a member of AKPsi. Moved in with one my
        close friends into my first apartment, and settled in for another year
        of learning. I had also discovered the sport of power lifting, and began
        training for my first meet which was being held at Western. After a long
        training period I earned 3rd place and had a chance to compete in front
        of a great number of people. Classes got harder but I met more friends.
        I got stuck with a couple tough classes but I powered through and
        thankfully, with the help of having my friends in those classes, it was
        not too bad. I was also nominated and elected the Vice President of
        AKPsi and continued on as I searched for my first internship. With my
        friends, I also had a chance to learn the game of softball
        <em>(and baseball)</em> by playing intramural softball in Spring
        quarter. It was very fun learning a new sport and also understanding a
        new sport that at first glance seems so confusing if you've never played
        After securing an internship through close connections, I had the
        opportunity to travel to Warsaw, Poland where I worked at a real estate
        firm. It was a very rewarding experience where I learned a lot about
        business and real estate. Outside of work I also had the opportunity to
        explore the city and get involved in the culture which is so close to
        mine.
