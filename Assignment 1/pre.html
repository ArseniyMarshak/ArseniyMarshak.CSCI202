        Before coming to Western I had to endure like everyone else in the world
        a crazy shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic stifled the
        momentum of junior year and crept into my senior year. Deciding where to
        go to school was not the easiest as I had considered many different
        majors and schools. I knew I wanted stay in state but I wasn't sure
        where I would end up for school. The ultimate goal was UW, is it was for
        many people I knew. Unfortunately, I didn't get in but I had applied to
        all the other schools in Washington which led me to choosing between
        Western, Central, and Washington State. I landed on Western for its
        affordability, proximity to home, majors (at the time journalism), and
        overall environment.
