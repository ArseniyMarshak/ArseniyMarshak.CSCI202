    <h1>Unplugging from my phone!</h1>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I was given an interesting task of unplugging from my
      phone and computer for a whole day. Friday night I had given myself time
      to prepare for the unplugging. I didn't let my friends know that I was
      unplugging from my phone as I wanted to see how I fair not having that
      easy access to contact people. Through out the period of unplugging I had
      felt tempted to grab my phone whenever I had downtime. Though I was
      spending time with people around me, my roommates and friends, I still
      felt the urge to sit down and get on my phone to scroll through instagram
      or watch youtube. I knew there were different sporting events that I
      wanted to keep up with going on during the time of me unplugging so it was
      certainly difficult not being in the know. Another weird feeling was not
      having the phone next to me or on me. Usually I have the phone in my
      pocket or sitting on my desk right next to my hand for easy access. Not
      having my phone readily accessible made me feel rather uneasy because it
      felt like people would be texting, calling, or sending me things while I
      was not there. It felt almost like someone was trying to talk to you and
      you also wanted to talk to them but there was a one way mirror facing you.
      <br />
      After and during unplugging, as my brain started to settle, I felt more
      focused and clear. My brain wasn't scattered and it almost felt like my
      other senses were heightened. Due to the sunny days, I spent time outside
      and it felt good to see the colors of the surroundings, almost in a
      different hue. I also felt clear and quiet, as if a noise in my head was
      suddenly fading away. After unplugging from my phone I certainly felt how
      much information is constantly being uploaded to our brains and how it
      becomes overwhelming without us even feeling it.
      <br />
      Once I plugged back in it felt much easier to unplug for a more prolonged
      period of time, allowing me to take more control over when I check my
      phone or use it. I will definitely pursue doing more unplugging from my
      phone and the internet in search of a clearer, more focused mind.
