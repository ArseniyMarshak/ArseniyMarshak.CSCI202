    <h1 class="header p-2 m-0">The Haskell Plaza Story</h1>
    <p class="containter-fluid p-3" id="explain">
      Welcome to the Haskell Plaza! A point of campus that we all have traversed
      through and might have even made a stop on a warm, sunny day to study or
      soak in the sun. But our connection to our phones has us so sucked into
      the screen that we forget to <strong>look up and look around.</strong
      ><br />
      Today we will explore the plaza and the mini bronze people created by Tom
      Otterness, we will pair up to collaborate on writing our own stories for
      the bronze figures.
    </p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <div>
      <ul class="container-fluid list-unstyled p-0">
        <li class="list-item p-2">
          Each figure or set of figures must have a name
        </li>
        <li class="list-item p-2">
          Each figure or set of figures must have a personality
        </li>
        <li class="list-item p-2">
          Keep each story point within 200 words since we are limited on time
        </li>

          After you're done you will come back to view your story come together
